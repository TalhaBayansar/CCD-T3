# T3 Stack - Todoey

### Tailwind

Tailwindcss is a utility-first CSS framework. This means that it will expose classes such as `m-1`, `m-2`, `m-3`, etc. to add a margin, or `text-center` to center your text.

Have a look at https://tailwindcss.com/ for more examples.

Let's add some Ordina colors to the configuration, so that we will get classes with this color.

In `tailwind.config.js` (in the root directory), paste the following inside the `theme.extend` section:

```
colors: {
	primary: {
		100: '#ebf8ff',
		200: '#bee3f8',
		300: '#E37C30',
		400: '#63b3ed',
		500: '#E7904B',
		600: '#3182ce',
		700: '#EAB285',
		800: '#2c5282',
		900: '#F7D1A7',
	},
}
```

Tailwindcss will use these variables to create utility classes.

It will for example create a class `bg-primary-500`, and this class will add a background-color in our defined primary color.

Or if you wanted the text to have this color you could use the class `text-primary-500`.

### Our first page

Go to `/src/pages/index.tsx` and replace the boilerplate code with the following.

```

import React from 'react';
import { type  NextPage } from  "next";

import  Head  from  "next/head";



const  Home: NextPage = () => {

return (

	<>

		<Head>

			<title>Todoey</title>

			<meta  name="description"  content="This is the Todoey app."  />

			<link  rel="icon"  href="/favicon.ico"  />

		</Head>

		<main>Hello Bold!</main>

	</>

);

};



export  default  Home;
```

The code inside the Head tag should be familiar. We gave the name of the application as the title, added a description meta tag and added a favicon.
